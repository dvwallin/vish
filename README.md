# vlsh
A shell coded in [V](https://vlang.io). Work in progress.

## Install
either
```
git clone https://github.com/dvwallin/vlsh.git
cd vlsh
v .
./vlsh
```

or
```
git clone https://github.com/dvwallin/vlsh.git
cd vlsh
v run vlsh.v
```

## Use
vlsh is **NOT** stable enough for daily use or any kind of production.
If you wanna use it just compile it and run it and experiment but there will be loads of bugs.

To get debug-info simply start it like so: `VLSHDEBUG=true vlsh` or `VLSHDEBUG=true v run vlsh.v`
